        Sudoku puzzles are solved by putting numbers 1 - 9 once in each row, column and block (3x3 cells), 9 blocks, 81 cells total. 
        The numbers can be in any order. You must use the surrounding numbers to eliminate possibilities for each cell. When there 
        is only one option for a cell, click that number and use it to figure out the rest of the puzzle. 
        There is only one solution for each puzzle. 
    </p>;

        <h3>Elimination on Squares</h3>
        <p>
            This app does the EoS method for you. It looks at each cell and if, for example, a 4 is in the same row as the empty cell, the app removes 4 from the number options. 
            It also does this for the columns and blocks. If there is only one option for a cell, the app will <span className="red-back">"cross out"</span> that 
            option from other cells in the corresponding row, column, and block. This app basically solves all the easy/medium puzzles for you. 
        </p>
        <h3>Elimination on Numbers</h3>
        <p>
            Once all the number options for each cell has been found (Sudoku Trainer does this for you), there may only be one number option in a row, column, or block. For example, 
            in a column there could be only one cell that has a number 6 option. That cell may have other number possibilites but because there must be a 6 in each column,
            that cell must be 6. The <span className="highlight">"Highlight Numbers"</span> tool can help you with the EoN strategy. Highlight a number and if that number only appears as an option once 
            in a row, column, or block, then it must be an answer for that cell. 
        </p>
        <h3>Solving on Possibilities in Common</h3>
        <p>
            If there are two cells in a row, column, or block with the same 2 number options, those numbers can be eliminated from the rest of the row, column, or block. For example, 
            if a block has 3 cells with number options [2, 7], [2, 7], and [2, 7, 9], we know the the first two cells are a 2 and 7 in some order. Which means 
            the third cell must be a 9 because the 2 and 7 are in the other two cells of the block. This works with 3 cells with the same 3 number options, as well as 4 cells 
            with the same 4 number options, and so forth. Use the <span className="red-back">"Manual Cross Out"</span> tool to mark options that have been eliminated.
